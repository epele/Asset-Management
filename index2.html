<h1 align="center">What am I trying to do</h1>
<p align="center">Asset management, broadly defined, refers to any system that monitors and
  maintains things of value to an entity or group. <br>It may apply to both tangible
  assets (such as buildings) and to intangible assets such as human capital,
  intellectual property, goodwill<br> and/or financial assets). Asset management is a
  systematic process of developing, operating, maintaining, upgrading,
  and disposing of assets cost-effectively.<br>
  The term is most commonly used in the financial sector to describe peoples
  and companies whose manages investments on behalf of others.<br> Those include,
  for example, investment managers that manage the assets of a pension fund.<br><br>

  Alternative views of asset management<br> in the engineering environment are:
  the practice of managing assets to <br>achieve the greatest return
  (particularly useful for productive assets such as plant and equipment),
  and the process of monitoring and maintaining<br> facilities systems,
  with the objective of providing the best possible service to users in all
  dimensions (appropriate for public infrastructure assets).</p>
